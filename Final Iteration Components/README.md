After the chair's rough design was drawn on paper, I began creating its components in CAD.
The original design remained the same for the most part.
Past iterations mainly included small changes such as measurement optimizations, and later included a lateral support system between the legs of the chair. All of which culminated in V4, my final design, which successfully met all of the requirements and remained extremely lightweight.
