# Lightweight_Structural_Chair_Design
Designed and prototyped a load-bearing chair using foam board, optimizing structural geometry to support user weight despite low-strength material constraints.

Team academic design project. Responsible for all structural design, CAD modeling, and iteration testing.

The goal of this project was to design and construct a sustainable chair made of structurally weak foam board without using any fasteners, glue, tape, or other adhesives.

Functional Requirements:
1.  Hold an 80kg person
2.  480mm < Seat height < 530 mm
3.  380 < seat depth < 420 mm
4.  380 < seat width < 420 mm
5.  250 < backrest height > 450 mm
6.  Made entirely of 18" x 24" x 3/16" (5mm) foam core board
7.  No adhesives
8.  Mass < 500g
